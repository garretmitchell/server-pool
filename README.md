# Tip-Pool Application
## What Does It Do?
This application allows you to store extremely important information for use in a restaurant setting. The program allows you to store employee names while also inputting their total sales and tip amounts. The program has the ability to not only store this information but also computes the exact percentage of tip on the total bill a customer left for the empployee. Lastly, the program allows you to remove inputted information as well. 
I used HTML,CSS, and multiple JS files to achieve what I wanted to achieve with this application. The reasoning for multiple JS files is because this application performs many functions, so in order to have every function execute correctly it was important to organize all of the JS code accordingly. It also allowed for more organized testing. 
The largest issue I faced while coding this application was dealing with a larger code base than what I am used to up to this point.
## How to run the application?
I have made this application reachable in the browser through github pages. 
## How to use the application?
Simply enter a total bill amount, enter what was left for a tip, and enter an employees name. Submit both forms and you will see a total summary info as well as a total profit for that employee. 
## Who can edit this repository?
Anyone can add code to this application if necessary!
